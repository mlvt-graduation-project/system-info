# Guide to Using Python Virtual Environments (venv)

A virtual environment isolates your Python dependencies, ensuring your project has a consistent and conflict-free setup.

---

## 1. **Creating a Virtual Environment**

To create a virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Create the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   - Replace `venv` with your preferred directory name for the virtual environment.

---

## 2. **Activating the Virtual Environment**

### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### On Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

When activated, your terminal will show the virtual environment name as a prefix, e.g., `(venv)`.

## 3. **Installing Dependencies**

Once the virtual environment is activated, use `pip` to install your dependencies:
```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Save the installed packages to a `requirements.txt` file for future use:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
```bash
deactivate
```

---

## 5. **Recreating the Environment from `requirements.txt`**

To recreate the environment on another machine:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (as described above).
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 6. **Adding Virtual Environment to `.gitignore`**

Ensure the virtual environment folder is excluded from version control by adding the following to your `.gitignore` file:

```plaintext
venv/
```

---

## 7. **Best Practices**

- Always use a virtual environment for each project to avoid dependency conflicts.
- Regularly update your `requirements.txt` file when installing or upgrading packages.
- Avoid committing the `venv` directory to version control.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your Python projects with virtual environments!
